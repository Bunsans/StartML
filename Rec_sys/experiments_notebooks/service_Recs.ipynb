For five days, they will discuss issues ranging from Chinas economic power to Iraqs future after this Sundays elections. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and South African President Thabo Mbeki are among the more than 20 government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting. Unlike previous years, protests against the WEF are expected to be muted. Anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend.\\n\\nThe Brazilian city of Porto Alegre will host the rival World Social Forum, timed to run in parallel with the WEFs ritzier event in Davos.\\n\\nThe organisers of the Brazilian gathering, which brings together thousands of campaigners against globalisation, for fair trade, and many other causes, have promised to set an alternative agenda to that of the Swiss summit. However, many of the issues discussed in Porto Alegre are Davos talking points as well. Global warming features particularly high. WEF participants are being asked to offset the carbon emissions they cause by travelling to the event. Davos itself is in deep frost. The snow is piled high across the mountain village, and at night the wind chill takes temperatures down to minus 20C and less.\\n\\nUltimately, the forum will be dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the worlds 500 largest companies scheduled to attend.\\n\\nBut much of the media focus will be on the political leaders coming to Davos, not least because the agenda of this years forum seems to lack an overarching theme. Taking responsibility for tough choices is this years official talking point, hinting at a welter of knotty problems. One thing seems sure, though: transatlantic disagreements over how to deal with Iran, Iraq and China are set to dominate discussions. Pointedly, only one senior official from President Bushs new administration is scheduled to attend. The US government may still make a conciliatory gesture, just as happened a year ago when Vice President Dick Cheney made a surprise appearance in Davos.\\n\\nUkraines new president, Viktor Yushchenko, is to speak, just days after his inauguration, an event that crowned the civil protests against the rigged first election that had tried to keep him from power.\\n\\nThe European Unions top leaders, among them German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and European Commission President Manuel Barosso, will be here too. Mr Blair will formally open the proceedings, although his speech will be pre-empted by French President Jacques Chirac, who announced his attendance at the last minute and secured a slot for a special message two hours before Mr Blair speaks. The organisers also hope that the new Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, will use the opportunity for talks with at least one of the three Israeli deputy prime ministers coming to the event, a list that includes Shimon Peres. Davos fans still hark back to 1994, when talks between Yassir Arafat and Mr Peres came close to a peace deal. Mr Blairs appearance will be keenly watched too, as political observers in the UK claim it is a calculated snub against political rival Chancellor Gordon Brown, who was supposed to lead the UK government delegation.\\n\\nMicrosoft founder Bill Gates, the worlds richest man and a regular at Davos, will focus on campaigning for good causes, though business interests will not be wholly absent either. Having already donated billions of dollars to the fight against Aids and Malaria, Mr Gates will call on world leaders to support a global vaccination campaign to protect children in developing countries from easily preventable diseases. On Tuesday, Mr Gates pledged $750m (\\u00a3400m) of his own money to support the cause. Mr Gates company, software giant Microsoft, also hopes to use Davos to shore up its defences against open source software like Linux, which threaten Microsofts near monopoly on computer desktops. Mr Gates is said to be trying to arrange a meeting with Brazils President Lula da Silva. The Brazilian government has plans to switch all government computers from Microsoft to Linux. At Davos, global problem solving and networking are never far apart.\\n\",\n          \"President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced a $1.5 billion contract with US biotech company Moderna for 100 million\\u2026 https://t.co/pLde2M3bir\",\n          \"We provide Medical Service in #covid19\\nDownlode Apk/-https://t.co/baUq3wT6k9\\u2026\\n#services\\n#Ambulance Service\\n#Doctor&amp;\\u2026 https://t.co/NHhgfijhxv\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"business\",\n          \"covid\",\n          \"tech\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"len_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1262,\n        \"min\": 30,\n        \"max\": 25392,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2685,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1318,\n          3809,\n          1214\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":228}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["['exp_group_3', 'country_Turkey', 'country_Belarus', 'max_tfidf',\n","   'country_Kazakhstan', 'country_Finland', 'country_Switzerland',\n","   'country_Latvia', 'source_organic', 'os_iOS', 'country_Cyprus',\n","   'country_Estonia']"],"metadata":{"id":"aQD-0QhvEHRw"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# res_post_text = res_post_text.drop(['max_tfidf'],axis=1)\n","res_user = res_user.drop(['exp_group_3', 'country_Turkey', 'country_Belarus',\n","   'country_Kazakhstan', 'country_Finland', 'country_Switzerland',\n","   'country_Latvia', 'source_organic', 'os_iOS', 'country_Cyprus',\n","   'country_Estonia'],axis=1)"],"metadata":{"id":"wfGrcDKREYmf"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["res_post_text"],"metadata":{"id":"On-dDrSBKnEx","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709819197431,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":320,"user":{"displayName":"Александр Ким","userId":"11780695099251197275"}},"outputId":"a4566f86-395d-40ac-ec10-c25500e4c484","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":423}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["      post_id                                               text     topic  \\\n","0           1  UK economy facing major risks\\n\\nThe UK manufa...  business   \n","1           2  Aids and climate top Davos agenda\\n\\nClimate c...  business   \n","2           3  Asian quake hits European shares\\n\\nShares in ...  business   \n","3           4  India power shares jump on debut\\n\\nShares in ...  business   \n","4           5  Lacroix label bought by US firm\\n\\nLuxury good...  business   \n","...       ...                                                ...       ...   \n","7018     7315  OK, I would not normally watch a Farrelly brot...     movie   \n","7019     7316  I give this movie 2 stars purely because of it...     movie   \n","7020     7317  I cant believe this film was allowed to be mad...     movie   \n","7021     7318  The version I saw of this film was the Blockbu...     movie   \n","7022     7319  Piece of subtle art.

For five days, they will discuss issues ranging from Chinas economic power to Iraqs future after this Sundays elections. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and South African President Thabo Mbeki are among the more than 20 government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting. Unlike previous years, protests against the WEF are expected to be muted. Anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend.\\n\\nThe Brazilian city of Porto Alegre will host the rival World Social Forum, timed to run in parallel with the WEFs ritzier event in Davos.\\n\\nThe organisers of the Brazilian gathering, which brings together thousands of campaigners against globalisation, for fair trade, and many other causes, have promised to set an alternative agenda to that of the Swiss summit. However, many of the issues discussed in Porto Alegre are Davos talking points as well. Global warming features particularly high. WEF participants are being asked to offset the carbon emissions they cause by travelling to the event. Davos itself is in deep frost. The snow is piled high across the mountain village, and at night the wind chill takes temperatures down to minus 20C and less.\\n\\nUltimately, the forum will be dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the worlds 500 largest companies scheduled to attend.\\n\\nBut much of the media focus will be on the political leaders coming to Davos, not least because the agenda of this years forum seems to lack an overarching theme. Taking responsibility for tough choices is this years official talking point, hinting at a welter of knotty problems. One thing seems sure, though: transatlantic disagreements over how to deal with Iran, Iraq and China are set to dominate discussions. Pointedly, only one senior official from President Bushs new administration is scheduled to attend. The US government may still make a conciliatory gesture, just as happened a year ago when Vice President Dick Cheney made a surprise appearance in Davos.\\n\\nUkraines new president, Viktor Yushchenko, is to speak, just days after his inauguration, an event that crowned the civil protests against the rigged first election that had tried to keep him from power.\\n\\nThe European Unions top leaders, among them German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and European Commission President Manuel Barosso, will be here too. Mr Blair will formally open the proceedings, although his speech will be pre-empted by French President Jacques Chirac, who announced his attendance at the last minute and secured a slot for a special message two hours before Mr Blair speaks. The organisers also hope that the new Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, will use the opportunity for talks with at least one of the three Israeli deputy prime ministers coming to the event, a list that includes Shimon Peres. Davos fans still hark back to 1994, when talks between Yassir Arafat and Mr Peres came close to a peace deal. Mr Blairs appearance will be keenly watched too, as political observers in the UK claim it is a calculated snub against political rival Chancellor Gordon Brown, who was supposed to lead the UK government delegation.\\n\\nMicrosoft founder Bill Gates, the worlds richest man and a regular at Davos, will focus on campaigning for good causes, though business interests will not be wholly absent either. Having already donated billions of dollars to the fight against Aids and Malaria, Mr Gates will call on world leaders to support a global vaccination campaign to protect children in developing countries from easily preventable diseases. On Tuesday, Mr Gates pledged $750m (\\u00a3400m) of his own money to support the cause. Mr Gates company, software giant Microsoft, also hopes to use Davos to shore up its defences against open source software like Linux, which threaten Microsofts near monopoly on computer desktops. Mr Gates is said to be trying to arrange a meeting with Brazils President Lula da Silva. The Brazilian government has plans to switch all government computers from Microsoft to Linux. At Davos, global problem solving and networking are never far apart.\\n\",\n          \"President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced a $1.5 billion contract with US biotech company Moderna for 100

RHB, Malaysias third-biggest lender, is already scouting for a foreign partner for its new Islamic banking unit, the firm told Reuters. The moves put Malaysia ahead of a 2007 deadline to open up the sector. The countrys deal to join the World Trade Organisation set that year as a deadline for liberalisation of Islamic banking. Also on Tuesday, the central bank released growth figures showing Malaysias economy expanded 7.1% in 2004. But growth slowed sharply in the fourth quarter to 5.6%, and the central bank said it expected 6% expansion in 2005.\\n\\nMalaysia changed the law to allow Islamic banking in 1983. It has granted licences to three Middle Eastern groups, which - along with local players - mean there are eight fully-operational Islamic banking groups in the country. Islamic banks offer services which permit modern banking principles while sticking to Islamic laws ban on the payment of interest. Most of the Malays which make up half the countrys population are Muslims.\\n\",\n          \"@RonDeSantisFL doesnt care about our children.

Imagine killing your enemy/competitor in front of your young son..or forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove loyalty. There are some hints of the contrasting Corleone sons in Copollas Godfather that seem to resurface here in this Chinese/Hong Kong film but the quality of the two are as distinctly different as chalk and cheese.This film is only recommended for violence junkies..there is no great cinema here.

For five days, they will discuss issues ranging from Chinas economic power to Iraqs future after this Sundays elections. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and South African President Thabo Mbeki are among the more than 20 government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting. Unlike previous years, protests against the WEF are expected to be muted. Anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend.\\n\\nThe Brazilian city of Porto Alegre will host the rival World Social Forum, timed to run in parallel with the WEFs ritzier event in Davos.\\n\\nThe organisers of the Brazilian gathering, which brings together thousands of campaigners against globalisation, for fair trade, and many other causes, have promised to set an alternative agenda to that of the Swiss summit. However, many of the issues discussed in Porto Alegre are Davos talking points as well. Global warming features particularly high. WEF participants are being asked to offset the carbon emissions they cause by travelling to the event. Davos itself is in deep frost. The snow is piled high across the mountain village, and at night the wind chill takes temperatures down to minus 20C and less.\\n\\nUltimately, the forum will be dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the worlds 500 largest companies scheduled to attend.\\n\\nBut much of the media focus will be on the political leaders coming to Davos, not least because the agenda of this years forum seems to lack an overarching theme. Taking responsibility for tough choices is this years official talking point, hinting at a welter of knotty problems. One thing seems sure, though: transatlantic disagreements over how to deal with Iran, Iraq and China are set to dominate discussions. Pointedly, only one senior official from President Bushs new administration is scheduled to attend. The US government may still make a conciliatory gesture, just as happened a year ago when Vice President Dick Cheney made a surprise appearance in Davos.\\n\\nUkraines new president, Viktor Yushchenko, is to speak, just days after his inauguration, an event that crowned the civil protests against the rigged first election that had tried to keep him from power.\\n\\nThe European Unions top leaders, among them German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and European Commission President Manuel Barosso, will be here too. Mr Blair will formally open the proceedings, although his speech will be pre-empted by French President Jacques Chirac, who announced his attendance at the last minute and secured a slot for a special message two hours before Mr Blair speaks. The organisers also hope that the new Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, will use the opportunity for talks with at least one of the three Israeli deputy prime ministers coming to the event, a list that includes Shimon Peres. Davos fans still hark back to 1994, when talks between Yassir Arafat and Mr Peres came close to a peace deal. Mr Blairs appearance will be keenly watched too, as political observers in the UK claim it is a calculated snub against political rival Chancellor Gordon Brown, who was supposed to lead the UK government delegation.\\n\\nMicrosoft founder Bill Gates, the worlds richest man and a regular at Davos, will focus on campaigning for good causes, though business interests will not be wholly absent either. Having already donated billions of dollars to the fight against Aids and Malaria, Mr Gates will call on world leaders to support a global vaccination campaign to protect children in developing countries from easily preventable diseases. On Tuesday, Mr Gates pledged $750m (\\u00a3400m) of his own money to support the cause. Mr Gates company, software giant Microsoft, also hopes to use Davos to shore up its defences against open source software like Linux, which threaten Microsofts near monopoly on computer desktops. Mr Gates is said to be trying to arrange a meeting with Brazils President Lula da Silva. The Brazilian government has plans to switch all government computers from Microsoft to Linux. At Davos, global problem solving and networking are never far apart.\\n\",\n          \"President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced a $1.5 billion contract with US biotech company Moderna for 100 million\\u2026 https://t.co/pLde2M3bir\",\n          \"We provide Medical Service in #covid19\\nDownlode Apk/-https://t.co/baUq3wT6k9\\u2026\\n#services\\n#Ambulance Service\\n#Doctor&amp;\\u2026 https://t.co/NHhgfijhxv\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"business\",\n          \"covid\",\n          \"tech\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":216}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["res = [] # 'post_id'  'topic'  'text'\n","for i in result_recs_post:\n","    res.append({'post_id': i,\n","                'topic': res_post_text.loc[res_post_text[\"post_id\"] == i, 'topic'].values[0],\n","                'text': res_post_text.loc[res_post_text[\"post_id\"] == i, 'text'].values[0]})"],"metadata":{"id":"kX4p-b-eOYci","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709819574440,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":243,"user":{"displayName":"Александр Ким","userId":"11780695099251197275"}}},"execution_count":235,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["res"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"T2_YE1wwHZEJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709819575980,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":247,"user":{"displayName":"Александр Ким","userId":"11780695099251197275"}},"outputId":"9ab3e9b2-7377-4259-edcd-149fc1479de8"},"execution_count":236,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[{'post_id': 6485,\n","  'topic': 'movie',\n","  'text': 'There are some things I will never understand; why underwear comes in packs of threes when clearly thats not enough is an example. Similarly, I will never understand this film, and that is brilliant. If you approach this film expecting an actual movie, you might as well be approaching Satan expecting a hug; although that may well be possible if you greet this films Satanic figures. Take Pitch for instance; the most ineffectual, camp, unhellish portrayal of a devil since Freddy Mercury and Wayne Sleep joined forces to create a ten foot Satan costume from red body paint and horns covered with condoms. However, it does create some of the most hilarious moments of any film ever. Seriously, this is no understatement. The same can be applied to every other character, bar the little girl who acts so sickly innocent shes probably overcompensating for some serious crime shes part of. Then again, if Santas inter-space recon station is real, there is no chance she could have avoided him this long. Put simply, if you havent seen this movie, you cannot consider yourself a serious buff. The achingly funny characterisation, acting, concept, and almost-under-the-radar racism makes this a must see above any film to date (if youre after pure laughter that is).'},\n"," {'post_id': 6231,\n","  'topic': 'movie',\n","  'text': 'This movie has not aged well.

Not just the violence of it, but the mere idea that somehow this would be a satisfying ending.I enjoy a good shocker, but this seemed so out of character... Also, when was this move supposed to be set? The cars all seemed like they were from the 1960s, and yet the World Trade Center towers {completed in 1973} were clearly visible in many cityscape scenes.Another way in which the film has aged poorly is the mere idea that a passenger could travel coast to coast with a knife on his person.Somehow, mid-1980s audiences found this film charming and funny.
